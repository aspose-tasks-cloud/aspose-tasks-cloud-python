Then import the package:
```python
import asposetaskscloud
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python
import asposetaskscloud
import asposetaskscloud.models.requests
api_client = asposetaskscloud.ApiClient()
api_client.configuration.host = 'https://api.aspose.cloud'
api_client.configuration.api_key['api_key'] = '' # Put your appKey here
api_client.configuration.api_key['app_sid'] = '' # Put your appSid here
tasks_api = asposetaskscloud.TasksApi(api_client)
remote_name = 'SomeSeriousPlan.mpp'

upload_request = asposetaskscloud.models.requests.UploadFileRequest(file, remote_name)
upload_result = self.tasks_api.upload_file(request)
self.assertTrue(upload_result.code == 200, 'Error has occurred while uploading project file')

request = asposetaskscloud.models.requests.GetDocumentPropertiesRequest(remote_name)
result = tasks_api.get_document_properties(request)
self.assertTrue(result.code == 200, 'Error has occurred while getting document properties')

```
